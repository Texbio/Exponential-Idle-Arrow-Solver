# Exponential Idle Arrow Solver
Arrow Solver for the moble game Exponential Idle

**MADE USING GOOGLE'S AI, Gemini (Pro 2.5). THIS CODE IS NOT MY WORK!!**

If you want to get stars there are better ways (restarting the game and changing the clock back ~10 years, then you can change the clock day by day, you have to do it this way due to its "anticheat" detecting if you move your clock backwards)

I made this project because I thought it would be cool to complete all the challenges in this game, but realized that the arrow puzzles were just time consuming and hard to solve noramlly.


Instructions:
If you do not know how to run python, get Pycharm, one of the best IDEs for python. You can make a new project and drag the folder in.
Download all the required packages (uvicorn, fastapi, pydantic, numpy) (if you get any errors then maybe there are more?)
Run run.py
open main.html, and select whatever you want.

- From my testing the issues where certian puzzles cant be solved should be fixed
